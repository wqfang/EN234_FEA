%    The NODE command defines properties of the nodes.  
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier

%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       PARAMETERS, 6, 6, 1
%      Specify which nodal DOF are displacements.  In the example, DOF 1 is the x displacement, 2 is the y displacement, 3 is the z displacement
       DISPLACEMENT DOF, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

%       The DEGREE OF FREEDOM key assigns values to nodal DOFs

%   PRINT INITIAL MESH, Linear_elastic_3d/initial_mesh.dat

%   TIME, VALUE, 0.d0        % Use this to specify the initial time

%        The SOLVER key controls the equation solver and Newton-Raphson iterations
%        The options are FACTOR for direct solver, CONJUGATE GRADIENT for cg solver
%        Factor will work on anything but might be slow for large equation systems.   
%        Conjugate gradient works well for elasticity problems but (with the diagonal preconditioner used here) is not so good for unsymmetric matrices
%                        LINEAR for linear equations, NONLINEAR for nonlinear equations
%                        For nonlinear solver, must specify convergence tolerance and max # iterations
%                        UNSYMMETRIC  (optional - only for unsymmetric stiffness)

%      This prints the DOF values and projected nodal state for all solid elements to a tecplot readable file

%         The projected states are controlled by the user - see subroutine elstat in file usrelem.f90
%         Also (for this example file) subroutine state_linelast_3dbasic in file el_linelast_3Dbasic.f90
